## General Info

Perfect Plushies is a simple mod that adds 13 new plushie variants into Minecraft, which are used (for now, at least)
solely for decoration purposes. Decorate your bedroom, living room, garden, or quite literally anything with them, which
is always sure to plaster a smile on your face!

## More Details

Each of these plushies cannot be crafted in the game. In survival, animal plushies are found in village chests, and
player plushies can be found in treasure chests and shipwrecks around the world. These blocks donâ€™t do nothing, however.
Try right clicking them. The hidden easter eggs are bound to put a smile on your face :)

## Future

More plushies to come, as well as perks and other bonus things added to the plushies!
