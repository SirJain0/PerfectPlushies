## General Info

Perfect Plushies is a simple mod that adds 9 new plushie variants into Minecraft, which are used (for now, at least) solely for decoration purposes. Decorate your bedroom, living room, garden, or quite literally anything with them, which is always sure to plaster a smile on your face!

## More Details

Each of these plushies cannot be crafted in the game. In survival, there is only one way to obtain them, and that is through loot tables in villages. These plushies have a chance of spawning in every village’s loot table. These blocks don’t do nothing, however. Try right clicking them. The hidden easter eggs are bound to put a smile on your face :)

Note: This mod only works with Fabric API and not Forge.
